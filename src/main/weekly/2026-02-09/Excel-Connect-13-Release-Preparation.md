## Execution Notes

**Thursday:** Ray asked to set up formal check-in to assess where EC 1.3 release left off and how requirements have changed.

**Documentation Discovery:**
- Found EC Methods Guide in CX SharePoint folder
- Located function reference sheets grouped by feature set
- Converted multiple sheets to CSV format for analysis

**Function Analysis Process:**
- Extracted documented functions from EC 1.2 reference
- Identified implemented functions in EC 1.3 codebase
- Cataloged functions marked with `isHidden` tag in EC 1.3
- Used Claude to create comprehensive comparison document across all three categories

**Stakeholder Coordination:**
- Delivered comparison document to Ray
- Initiated dialog framework for key questions:
  - "Why did we set these functions to hidden?"
  - "Are any of the hidden functions of huge use to the CX team?"
  - Requirements changes since original 1.3 planning

**Strategic Preparation:**
- Built foundation for confident question-answering during kickoff meeting
- Shifted from reactive context-absorption to proactive preparation approach
- Established clear inventory baseline for cross-team discussions

## Validation / Execution
**Documentation Analysis:** Successfully extracted and converted EC Methods Guide into analyzable format for comprehensive function comparison.

**Function Inventory:** Complete comparison document delivered to Ray covering EC 1.2 documented functions, EC 1.3 implemented functions, and EC 1.3 hidden functions.

### Themes
Release preparation through systematic documentation analysis and stakeholder alignment.

## Documentation / Knowledge Transfer
- Created comprehensive function comparison document for EC 1.2 vs 1.3 analysis
- Established question framework for cross-team release discussions
- Converted SharePoint documentation to machine-readable format for future analysis

## Time Spent
Thursday work, estimated 3-4 hours for documentation extraction and analysis.

## Ratings
- **Knowledge / Fluency:** 4 *Strong understanding of function differences and implementation status*
- **My Ability to Service Clearly:** 4 *Prepared to lead deployment discussions confidently*
- **Team Ability to Service Clearly:** 3 *Cross-team coordination still developing*

## Growth Outcome
Developed systematic approach to release preparation through comprehensive documentation analysis and proactive stakeholder question development.

## Retrospective
**What went differently than planned?**
Documentation conversion and analysis went smoother than expected. Ray's collaborative approach to question development improved preparation strategy.

**Key learnings or gotchas:**
- CX SharePoint contains comprehensive EC Methods Guide documentation
- Function reference sheets are organized by feature set, making systematic analysis possible
- Hidden functions in EC 1.3 may have strategic value for CX team that needs evaluation
- Proactive preparation for stakeholder meetings more effective than reactive context absorption during meetings
