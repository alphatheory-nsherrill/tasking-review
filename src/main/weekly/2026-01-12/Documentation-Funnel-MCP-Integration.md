# Documentation Funnel - MCP Integration & Tooling

**Type:** Bug | **Feature** | Exploration | Other
**Est:** [X]h | **Confidence:** [X]%

## Problem & Goal
Expand on the existing documentation funnel system by integrating Claude Desktop and the Alpha Theory MCP project to automate document translation into consistent structures.

This week's focus shifts from format design to tooling setup - finding ways to translate documents I write (and documents in other formats) into constant structure. Whether it be weekly updates, task review worksheets, or database tables, this week will be the start of using other tools to help this process.

## Deliverables
- Claude Desktop setup with Alpha Theory MCP integration
- Document translation pipeline that converts various formats into consistent structures
- Automated generation of:
  - Weekly updates from task documents
  - Task review worksheets
  - Database table formats
- Working MCP integration for document processing and transformation

## Entry Points
*Key components and systems to understand first*
- Claude Desktop installation and configuration
- Alpha Theory MCP project architecture and capabilities
- Current task documents as input sources
- Target output formats: weekly updates, worksheets, database schemas
- Document transformation requirements and patterns
- Integration points between MCP and existing documentation funnel

## Plan
*High-level approach - bullet points preferred*
- Set up Claude Desktop environment
- Install and configure Alpha Theory MCP project
- Analyze existing task documents to identify transformation patterns
- Design document translation pipeline architecture
- Implement automated conversion from task docs to weekly updates
- Build task review worksheet generation capability
- Create database table format conversion
- Test end-to-end document transformation workflows
- Validate output quality across different target formats
- Optimize and refine transformation rules based on testing
