**Est:** [12]h | **Confidence:** [60]%

## Problem & Goal
Build a multi-level documentation funnel that connects individual task tracking to management deliverables and enterprise systems.

Current state: We have detailed task planning documents but they exist in isolation. Need to aggregate these into weekly .docx summaries for management, then explore higher-level trend analysis and integration with Jira/Confluence for comprehensive visibility across all organizational levels.

## Deliverables
- Documentation pipeline connecting task-level → weekly summaries → trend analysis
- Integration strategy/prototype for Jira/Confluence connectivity
- Automated or semi-automated aggregation system for multi-level reporting
- Trend analysis framework across historical task data

## Entry Points
*Key components and systems to understand first*
- Current .docx weekly template structure and management requirements
- Existing task tracking documents (like our improved template)
- Jira/Confluence APIs and integration capabilities
- Current data flow between task planning → weekly reporting
- Management reporting needs and consumption patterns
- ATLASSIAN MCP

## Plan
*High-level approach - bullet points preferred*
- Analyze current weekly .docx template and management deliverable requirements
- Design documentation funnel architecture (task → weekly → trends → enterprise)
- Research Jira/Confluence integration options (APIs, automation, data sync)
- Build aggregation mechanism from individual tasks to weekly summaries
- Create trend analysis framework for historical data mining
- Prototype enterprise system integration (Jira ticket linking, Confluence publishing)
- Design feedback loops between levels (management insights → task planning adjustments)
